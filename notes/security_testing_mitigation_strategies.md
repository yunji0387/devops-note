## Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Describe security testing.
- Describe mitigation strategies.
- List five key mitigation strategies.

## What is Security Testing?
- Security testing involves procedures for comparing the states of an application or a system to ensure they meet security standards.
- A secure code baseline should be established during development to facilitate these comparisons.
- It is essential to perform security tests on all new code to minimize the risk of security breaches.
- Security tests are also necessary after code changes to identify new vulnerabilities.

## Security Testing in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Security testing occurs during the Test stage of the SDLC, alongside code review.
- While prioritized during the Test phase, security testing should be integrated throughout the entire SDLC.

## Steps in Security Testing
1. Establish a secure baseline during the development phase.
2. Perform functional security testing to ensure the software behaves as expected under security requirements.
   - Functional testing includes:
     - **Ad hoc testing:** Conducted upon the discovery of vulnerabilities.
     - **Exploratory testing:** Involves testing theories or ideas outside formal testing structures.

## Automated Security Testing
- **Unit Testing:** Focuses on individual classes and methods to validate API contracts.
- **Integration Testing:** Tests the integration of multiple classes within an application across different application tiers.
- **Automation Frameworks:** Tools like BDD-Security, Mittn, and Gauntlt automate security testing and simplify integration with other security tools.

## Key Mitigation Strategies
1. **Use JSON for API Data:** Prefer JSON over XML for its simplicity and faster parsing.
2. **Implement Secure Coding Practices:** Establish and communicate security standards within your team and organization.
3. **Use Vulnerability Scanners:** Automate scanning to identify vulnerabilities in code.
4. **Threat Modeling:** Understand potential bad actor behaviors to better secure applications.
5. **Stay Updated with OWASP Top 10:** Regularly review and incorporate the OWASP Top 10 list into security testing practices.

## Summary
- Security tests are crucial for comparing the state of applications against security standards.
- Functional security testing is integral to ensuring software meets security requirements.
- Utilizing automated testing and strategic mitigation can significantly reduce the risks and impacts of security threats.
