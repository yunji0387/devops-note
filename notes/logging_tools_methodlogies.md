## Overview of Application Logging
- **Definition**: Application logging involves a series of messages from an application that record the application's activities.
- **Purpose**: Provides essential information for debugging and maintaining applications in production environments.

## Key Components of Application Logs
- **Content**: Logs contain details about events such as errors, informational messages, and warnings.
- **Evolution**: Traditionally stored in files; modern cloud-native applications use stdout for logging to facilitate data collection.
- **Usage**: Helps identify application issues like message flow problems and user/system actions.

## What to Log
- **Data to Include**:
  - Application messages, transaction flow events, and system alerts (e.g., low disk space).
  - Error events, success and failure audits (e.g., logon successes and failures).
  - Detailed tracking of API endpoints, request parameters, headers, and business context.
- **Security and Compliance**:
  - Separate logs for data-related operations with detailed access IDs, timestamps, and before/after states.

## Importance of Logging
- **Diagnostics**:
  - Track and analyze customer transactions, security threats, and system performance.
  - Identify and resolve production bugs and optimize long-term application performance.
- **Auditing**:
  - Record significant events for management, financial data, and compliance purposes.

## Best Practices for Effective Logging
- **Design and Test Logs**: As meticulously as the application itself to ensure useful data collection.
- **Analytical Use**: Leverage log data for insights using management tools.
- **Logging Levels**:
  - Use lower levels like TRACE or DEBUG for detailed context useful in debugging.

## Conclusion
- **Takeaway**: Logging is crucial for diagnostics and auditing, providing insights into application behavior and supporting business requirements.
- **Action Point**: Always ensure robust logging practices to maintain a clear understanding of application operations.
