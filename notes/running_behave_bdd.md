# Using Behave to Generate Python Steps

Behave is a powerful tool that can help generate steps for your BDD tests. It can create initial steps or identify missing ones during the development of your feature scenarios.

## Generating Steps with Behave

When you run Behave against a feature file, it processes the file and outputs any missing steps. The output will include:

- The filename and line number of the feature.
- The line number of each scenario within the feature file.
- A color-coded status for each step:
  - **Yellow** for undefined steps.
  - **Blue** for skipped steps, which Behave skips after encountering an undefined step.

After running the scenarios, Behave provides a summary of the results, including the count of passed, failed, skipped, or undefined steps. If you haven't written any steps, all the steps will be reported as undefined.

## Behave's Output and Snippets

Behave not only identifies missing steps but also suggests code snippets that you can use to start building your steps file. The output includes:

- A clear indication of the type of step (Given, When, or Then) through appropriate decorators.
- The text to match each step as a string.
- A placeholder implementation that raises a `NotImplementedError`, which you'll need to replace with actual step code.

This functionality serves as a starting point for developing your steps file and ensures coverage for all your scenarios.

## Example Output

When you run Behave with an incomplete steps file, you might see something like this:

```plaintext
Feature: Search for dogs - pets.feature:1
  Scenario: search for dogs - pets.feature:7
    When I visit the "Home Page" - None
    Then I should see "Welcome to the Pet Shop" - None
    ...

1 feature passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
1 scenario passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
5 steps passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 5 undefined
```
You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:
```python
@given('...')
def step_impl(context):
    raise NotImplementedError('STEP: Given ...')

@when('...')
def step_impl(context):
    raise NotImplementedError('STEP: When ...')

@then('...')
def step_impl(context):
    raise NotImplementedError('STEP: Then ...')
```
Copy and paste these snippets into your steps file to begin fleshing out the step implementations.

## Summary
- Behave's step generation feature simplifies the process of starting BDD test development.
- It provides a structured way to ensure all scenarios are accounted for with corresponding steps.
- The snippets offered by Behave form the skeleton of your steps file, which you will then develop with actual test code.
