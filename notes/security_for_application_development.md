<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

Welcome to the course on application security, tailored specifically for developers and DevOps professionals. This course aims to educate software engineers on embracing the DevOps mantra of "If you build it, you run it," with a strong focus on security practices.

## Course Overview

- **Target Audience**: Developers and DevOps professionals; this course does not cover infrastructure security, which is typically handled by security teams and SREs.
- **Purpose**: To address the persistent security risks and concerns that have remained almost unchanged over the past two decades, despite advancements in technology and software engineering.

## Key Points

- The OWASP top 10 list highlights that many of the major security concerns for developers have remained consistent since 2007.
- A report by IBM revealed that the average time to detect a data breach is 212 days, with an average cost of $9.4 million in the US and $4.3 million globally.
- There's a critical need for developers to implement basic security measures to prevent attacks and minimize vulnerabilities.

## Course Content

### Introduction to DevSecOps

- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security proactively into the software development process.
- **Network Security**: Utilizing modern TLS and OpenSSL for securing applications.

### Planning and Vulnerability Management

- How to incorporate security into your development plan effectively.
- Learning about vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, and threat monitoring.

### Security Tools and Practices

- Hands-on labs focusing on analyzing code using static and dynamic analysis tools.
- Introduction to the OWASP top 10 list and common vulnerabilities exploited by hackers.
- Setting up tools like Vault Secrets Manager and learning to secure code, dependencies, and development environments.

### Course Goals

- Understand common security risks and vulnerabilities.
- Learn to code defensively and ensure applications are secure by design.
- Gain practical experience with security tools and procedures to mitigate risks.

## Personal Insight

The instructor shares a personal anecdote about the importance of security in development and the challenges faced when deployments are stopped due to security concerns. This course is designed to equip developers with the knowledge and tools needed to prevent such scenarios and to promote secure coding practices.

## Conclusion

This course is not just theoretical; it emphasizes practical, hands-on learning through labs, quizzes, and peer interactions. It encourages collaboration and aims to prepare participants to handle security challenges effectively, ensuring they can secure their applications and systems confidently.

Join this course to learn how to make your applications secure by design and to navigate the complexities of application security with ease.

# Security by Design and Secure SDLC Integration
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

Welcome to "Security by Design"! This course segment will enhance your understanding of implementing security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and integrating it with DevOps practices.

## Learning Objectives

After this session, you will be able to:

- **Describe Security by Design**: Understanding the importance of incorporating security from the start of the development process.
- **Explain the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**: Detailing the steps involved and how security measures are integrated at each stage.
- **Map DevOps into a Secure SDLC**: Aligning DevOps practices with security requirements throughout the development phases.

## Secure SDLC Overview

### Importance of Early Security Integration

- Security should be considered from the outset, not as an afterthought.
- Collaborate closely and regularly with security teams to ensure code is developed securely.

### SDLC Stages and Security Integration

1. **Requirements**: Identify security needs and standards. Perform risk assessments and attack profiling.
2. **Design**: Focus on secure design principles. Conduct threat modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Development**: Use static analysis tools to check for security vulnerabilities. Implement a secure scrum framework.
4. **Testing**: Include vulnerability scans and security testing. Use parallel testing to reduce time and improve efficiency.
5. **Deployment**: Ensure secure deployment practices. Utilize automated scripts and perform rollback if necessary. Conduct production security tests to simulate real-world hacking attempts.

### Secure DevOps Practices

- Instruct development teams on common threats and help create targeted unit tests.
- Validate automated data for accuracy and relevance.
- Employ continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to detect vulnerabilities.

## Key Takeaways

- Security by Design and Secure SDLC are critical for developing high-quality, secure software.
- Effective collaboration with security teams is essential for smooth feature implementation and secure operations.
- By mapping security considerations into the SDLC, you can preemptively address potential threats and ensure robust application security.

In summary, integrating security into the SDLC and DevOps processes not only enhances the security of the applications but also ensures a smoother implementation and operation of new features.
