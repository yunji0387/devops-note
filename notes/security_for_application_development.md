# Application Security for Developers and DevOps Professionals

Welcome to the course on application security, tailored specifically for developers and DevOps professionals. This course aims to educate software engineers on embracing the DevOps mantra of "If you build it, you run it," with a strong focus on security practices.

## Course Overview

- **Target Audience**: Developers and DevOps professionals; this course does not cover infrastructure security, which is typically handled by security teams and SREs.
- **Purpose**: To address the persistent security risks and concerns that have remained almost unchanged over the past two decades, despite advancements in technology and software engineering.

## Key Points

- The OWASP top 10 list highlights that many of the major security concerns for developers have remained consistent since 2007.
- A report by IBM revealed that the average time to detect a data breach is 212 days, with an average cost of $9.4 million in the US and $4.3 million globally.
- There's a critical need for developers to implement basic security measures to prevent attacks and minimize vulnerabilities.

## Course Content

### Introduction to DevSecOps

- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security proactively into the software development process.
- **Network Security**: Utilizing modern TLS and OpenSSL for securing applications.

### Planning and Vulnerability Management

- How to incorporate security into your development plan effectively.
- Learning about vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, and threat monitoring.

### Security Tools and Practices

- Hands-on labs focusing on analyzing code using static and dynamic analysis tools.
- Introduction to the OWASP top 10 list and common vulnerabilities exploited by hackers.
- Setting up tools like Vault Secrets Manager and learning to secure code, dependencies, and development environments.

### Course Goals

- Understand common security risks and vulnerabilities.
- Learn to code defensively and ensure applications are secure by design.
- Gain practical experience with security tools and procedures to mitigate risks.

## Personal Insight

The instructor shares a personal anecdote about the importance of security in development and the challenges faced when deployments are stopped due to security concerns. This course is designed to equip developers with the knowledge and tools needed to prevent such scenarios and to promote secure coding practices.

## Conclusion

This course is not just theoretical; it emphasizes practical, hands-on learning through labs, quizzes, and peer interactions. It encourages collaboration and aims to prepare participants to handle security challenges effectively, ensuring they can secure their applications and systems confidently.

Join this course to learn how to make your applications secure by design and to navigate the complexities of application security with ease.
