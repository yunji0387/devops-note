## Overview

Kubernetes is a robust system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. It automates the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.

## Cluster Architecture

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster
- A set of nodes that run containerized applications.
- Consists of one master node (the control plane) and several worker nodes.

### 2. Control Plane
- Maintains the desired state of the cluster.
- Key components:
    - **API Server (kube-apiserver)**: The front-end of the control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API, handling internal and external communication.
    - **etcd**: Reliable distributed data store that persistently stores the cluster configuration.
    - **Scheduler (kube-scheduler)**: Assigns work, i.e., pods, to nodes based on resource availability.
    - **Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)**: Regulates the state of the cluster, ensuring the desired state matches the actual state.
    - **Cloud Controller Manager**: Interacts with underlying cloud providers, allowing cloud-specific interactions.

### 3. Worker Nodes
- Host the running applications (user workloads).
- Can be virtual or physical machines.
- Key components:
    - **Pods**: Smallest deployable units that contain one or more containers which share resources.
    - **Kubelet**: An agent that ensures the pods are running as expected.
    - **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, Podman, Cri-o).
    - **Kube-proxy**: Maintains network rules for communication to and from pods.

## Communication Flow

- All components communicate through the **Kubernetes API Server**, ensuring consistent state management.
- **Kubelet** and **kube-proxy** are node-level proxies that facilitate effective pod and service networking.

## Scalability and Reliability

- Kubernetes supports horizontal scalability, both at the application and cluster level.
- **etcd** provides high availability and reliability for data storage.
- **kube-apiserver** is designed for horizontal scaling; instances can be increased for load balancing.

## Pluggability

- Kubernetes supports various container runtimes through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).
- The system is cloud-agnostic, with native support for major cloud providers through the **cloud-controller-manager**.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a comprehensive container orchestration platform that automates the deployment and scaling processes, designed for extensibility and compatibility with a range of container runtimes and cloud providers. Its architecture is built to ensure application resilience, scalability, and optimal resource utilization.

<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Introduction
* Kubectl is the command-line interface (CLI) for Kubernetes.
* It allows management of Kubernetes clusters and workloads.
* Essential for deploying applications, managing resources, viewing logs, etc.

## Kubectl Command Structure
* **Command**: Operation to be performed (e.g., `create`, `get`, `apply`, `delete`).
* **Type**: Resource type (e.g., `pod`, `deployment`, `ReplicaSet`).
* **Name**: Resource name (specific to the resource).
* **Flags**: Special options/modifiers (override default behavior).

## Types of Kubectl Commands
1. **Imperative Commands**
   - Direct interaction with live objects.
   - Easy to learn and fast to execute.
   - No audit trail; not ideal for production.
   - Example: `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`

2. **Imperative Object Configuration**
   - Use YAML or JSON files for resource configuration.
   - Files can be version controlled, providing an audit trail.
   - Requires understanding of object schema.
   - Example: `kubectl create -f nginx.yaml`

3. **Declarative Object Configuration**
   - Define the desired state in a YAML or JSON file.
   - Kubectl automatically applies changes.
   - Ideal for production use.
   - Example: `kubectl apply -f configs/`

## Commonly Used Kubectl Commands
* `kubectl get`: Retrieve resources.
* `kubectl delete`: Remove resources.
* `kubectl apply`: Apply changes to resources.
* `kubectl scale`: Adjust the number of replicas.
* ... (additional commands can be listed)

## Examples of Command Usage
* List services in the current namespace: `kubectl get services`
* Create resources from a URL: `kubectl apply -f https://example.com/config.yaml`
* Scale a ReplicaSet: `kubectl scale replicaset foo --replicas=3`
* Create a deployment with replicas: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` (with replica configuration in the file)

## Conclusion
* Kubectl is essential for interacting with Kubernetes.
* Various command types suit different scenarios (development, production).
* Declarative configuration is best for production environments due to its automation and consistency features.

## References
* More information and the full kubectl command reference can be found on [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands).
