# IBM Cloud Code Engine Overview

## Challenges of Self-hosting Microservices
- **Configuration and Building**:
  - Making microservices production-ready involves configuring library dependencies, resources, credentials, etc.
  - Microservices need to be compiled and built into an executable binary.
- **Infrastructure Selection**:
  - Choices involve web servers, operating systems, networks, databases, etc.
- **Scaling**:
  - Microservices must scale dynamically based on traffic, e.g., peak traffic during holidays.
- **Communication**:
  - Communication among microservices should be reliable and secure.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Logging, monitoring, and dashboard activities are required for stability.

### Example: Python-based Microservice Deployment
- **Web Server Interfaces**:
  - **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface): Synchronous service calls.
    - Popular servers: Green Unicorn, uWSGI.
  - **ASGI** (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface): Supports asynchronous calls.
    - Popular servers: Daphne, Hypercorn.
- **Infrastructure**: Can range from a laptop to a sophisticated cluster.

## IBM Cloud Code Engine Solution

### Overview
- **Purpose**: Eases the deployment burden, allowing developers to focus on code.
- **Type**: Fully managed, serverless platform.
- **Features**: Combines PaaS, CaaS, and serverless deployment models.

### Use Cases
1. **Deploy Built Applications**:
   - Deploy microservices, web apps, or console apps directly.
2. **Push Source Code Directly**:
   - Code Engine builds and deploys applications from source code (GitHub or local).
3. **Run Batch Jobs**:
   - Deploy data processing or analytics tasks on the same platform.

### Benefits
- **Cluster Management**: Handles provisioning, configuring, scaling, and server management.
- **Focus on Code**: Developers can concentrate on code development.
- **Quick Deployment**: Builds and deploys apps in seconds.
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales workloads up and down.
- **Security and Isolation**: Ensures secure connections and isolates workloads.
- **Integration**: Fully integrates with the IBM Cloud services catalog.

## Conclusion
- Self-hosted microservices deployment can be complex.
- IBM Cloud Code Engine simplifies the deployment process, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- The platform supports application deployment, direct source code deployment, and batch job execution.

# Overview of Project, Application, Build, and Jobs in IBM Cloud Code Engine

## **Project**
- **Definition**: A group in Code Engine that manages resources and entities (e.g., build, app, job, TLS certificates).
- **Functions**:
  - **Namespace**: Provides isolation for entities. Entity names must be unique within a namespace but can be duplicated across namespaces.
  - **Access Control**: Manages resources and provides control over who can access what.
  - **Monitoring**: Allows monitoring of resource allocation (CPU, memory) for the entire project.
- **Example**: A project named `my-project` may have 11 applications and 2 jobs.

## **Application**
- **Definition**: Code that runs to serve HTTP requests or provide REST APIs.
- **Features**:
  - Supports **WebSockets** for long-running, session-based communication.
  - **Auto-scaling**: Dynamically scales up or down based on workload and configuration settings.
- **Example**: An application named `my-application` under the project `my-project`.

## **Build**
- **Definition**: Process of creating a container image from source code.
- **Methods**:
  - **Dockerfile**: A set of instructions to create a Docker container image.
  - **Cloud Native Buildpack**: Automates tasks like inspecting code and creating a build plan to produce an image.
- **Usage**: After building the container image, it can be deployed to Code Engine to create an application.

## **Job**
- **Definition**: A one-time execution of code.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Unlike applications, jobs are designed to run once and exit.
  - Can specify workload configurations before running.
- **Examples of Jobs**:
  - **Data Processing**: Query and transform data in batches.
  - **Machine Learning**: Model training jobs.
  - **Reporting**: Generate reports based on a schedule.
  - **Billing**: Create and send bills.

## **Conclusion**
- **Project**: Groups and manages Code Engine entities.
- **Application**: Serves HTTP requests or WebSocket sessions.
- **Build**: Creates a container image from source code.
- **Job**: Executes code once or in multiple instances.
