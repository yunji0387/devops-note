## Key Types of Monitoring

### System Monitoring
- **Purpose**: Ensures information about system availability, uptime, and application performance.
- **Components**: Includes server management, infrastructure monitoring, and network monitoring.
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Constantly checks if the application is operational and responsive.

### Dependency Monitoring
- **Function**: Maps and evaluates the resources an application relies on within a distributed IT infrastructure.
- **Importance**: Helps identify where issues originate, which is crucial for maintaining application performance.

### Integration Monitoring
- **Scope**: Focuses on third-party integrations essential for modern applications.
- **Benefits**: Ensures that these integrations are performing well, which is critical for the overall performance of the application.

### Web Performance Monitoring
- **Details**: Tracks web server availability and provides insights into page loading times and error locations.
- **Advantage**: Helps developers optimize web-based applications for better user experience.

### Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
- **Metrics**: Tracks key business performance indicators such as retail sales and financial transactions.
- **Utility**: Allows businesses to understand how applications impact overall business performance.

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- **Coverage**: Extends from the application to underlying infrastructure and dependencies.
- **Metrics**: Includes resource consumption, error rates, response times, and user experience.
- **Goal**: Ensures applications launch quickly and operate efficiently within the IT environment.

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- **Focus**: Captures real user interactions to provide a perspective on application or service performance from the user's viewpoint.
- **Data Provided**: Includes user retention on a site and load times, reflecting user satisfaction and application efficiency.

### Security Monitoring
- **Purpose**: Tracks network activities to identify and mitigate potential security threats.
- **Method**: Analyzes network log data to prevent attacks before they affect the business.

## Benefits of Monitoring Types
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Different types of monitoring provide comprehensive insight into various aspects of IT systems and business performance.
- **Optimal Performance**: Each monitoring type is tailored to specific IT functions, ensuring that all system components perform at their best.
- **Informed Decision Making**: Monitoring tools help businesses make decisions that enhance application performance and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion
Understanding the different types of monitoring is crucial for selecting the right tools or combination of tools to achieve optimal visibility and performance in your software systems.

## The Four Golden Signals

### 1. Latency
- **Definition**: The time it takes from when a request is sent to when it is completed.
- **Importance**: High latency can lead users to abandon the application, hence monitoring both successful and failed request latencies is vital.
- **Action**: Set latency targets and monitor them to identify and address intermittent or consistent high latency issues.

### 2. Traffic
- **Definition**: Measures how in-demand your service is, reflecting user engagement.
- **Variants**: Can be measured as transactions per second, page or resource requests, and more.
- **Utility**: Helps in understanding user patterns and optimizing their experience by identifying highly trafficked or underperforming areas.

### 3. Errors
- **Definition**: Includes failed requests or those completed with incorrect information.
- **Monitoring Focus**: Track all errors, distinguishing between critical and less severe ones, to understand the health of the system from the user's perspective.
- **Types of Errors**: Visible server or client errors (e.g., HTTP 500 or 404) and less obvious errors like incorrect content delivery despite a 200 OK status.

### 4. Saturation
- **Definition**: The degree to which a system's resources are used, such as CPU or memory.
- **Impact**: High saturation can lead to performance degradation, while low saturation might indicate over-provisioning.
- **Management**: Setting utilization targets helps optimize resource use and maintain service performance.

## Importance of Golden Signals
- **Proactive Monitoring**: By focusing on these four signals, you can monitor the health of your application effectively and identify issues before they escalate.
- **Operational Efficiency**: They aid in troubleshooting, alerting, and capacity planning, which enhances the overall management of the application.
- **Strategic Response**: Enables targeted interventions, reducing the time and effort needed to diagnose and resolve issues.

## Practical Application
- **Scenario Example**: If an application shows high latency, using the Golden Signals can help quickly pinpoint whether the issue is due to traffic, errors, or saturation, allowing for faster resolution.
- **Impact on Business**: Ensures that the application performs optimally, enhancing user satisfaction and business performance.

## Conclusion
The Golden Signals of monitoring provide a foundational framework for effectively managing and improving the performance of web applications, ensuring they meet user needs and business objectives.

## Monitoring vs. Evaluation

### Monitoring
- **Nature**: Routine and ongoing operational activity.
- **Participants**: Typically performed by developers and their teams who are directly involved with the application.
- **Purpose**: Focuses on tracking application performance throughout the programming, testing, and post-deployment lifecycle.
- **Activities**: Involves collecting data to identify, measure, and visualize application performance, availability, resource usage, and any arising issues.
- **Frequency**: Conducted regularly and systematically.

### Evaluation
- **Nature**: Long-term and less frequent strategic activity.
- **Participants**: Usually conducted by managers, supervisors, or external parties who may not be involved in the application's development.
- **Purpose**: Assesses whether the application meets predefined goals and achieves expected outcomes, including its overall value and effectiveness.
- **Activities**: Involves reviewing the application's impact, usefulness, sustainability, and profitability at strategic points, such as during or after rollout.
- **Frequency**: Occurs a few times, often at critical milestones.

## Importance of Each Process

### Importance of Monitoring
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ensures that the application functions correctly and optimally.
- **Problem Identification**: Helps in quickly spotting and addressing performance issues or security vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Facilitates ongoing enhancements based on real-time data and user feedback.

### Importance of Evaluation
- **Strategic Assessment**: Measures how well the application aligns with business goals and user needs.
- **Value Demonstration**: Shows the application's relevance, profitability, and long-term viability.
- **Decision Making**: Supports higher-level decision-making about the application's future and resource allocation.

## Integration of Processes
- **Synergy**: While monitoring and evaluation are distinct, they complement each other; monitoring provides data critical for thorough evaluation.
- **Outcome-Oriented Development**: Together, they ensure that applications are not only functioning but also successful in meeting their intended goals.

## Conclusion
Monitoring ensures that an application performs well and meets operational standards, while evaluation assesses the application's strategic success and alignment with business outcomes. Both processes are crucial for delivering a healthy, valuable, and performant application to users.
