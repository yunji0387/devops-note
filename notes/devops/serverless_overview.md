# Introduction to Serverless Computing

## Overview
The video provides an introduction to **Serverless Computing**, explaining its concepts, evolution, characteristics, and benefits.

## Definition of Serverless Computing
- Defined by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** as building and running applications without server management.
- Applications are bundled as functions, executed, scaled, and billed based on demand.
- Combines **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** and **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** services.

## Evolution of IT Computing
- Evolutionary trend from traditional computing to serverless computing:
  - **Traditional Computing**: Physical machines, long deployment times, years of lifespan.
  - **Virtualization**: Use of VMs and containers, faster provisioning, days or weeks of lifespan.
  - **Serverless Computing**: Milliseconds to deploy, lifespan of seconds.

## Characteristics of Serverless Computing
- **Hostless**: No server management required.
- **Elastic**: Immediate autoscaling.
- **Automated Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic efficiently.
- **Stateless**: Faster performance and higher scalability.
- **Event-Driven**: Functions triggered by events.
- **High Availability**: Ensured without extra effort.
- **Usage-Based Billing**: Charged only for actual usage, not idle time.

## How Serverless Functions Work
- Developers write functions in languages supported by the cloud provider (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js, C#, Go).
- Functions are uploaded to the cloud and triggered by defined events.
- Cloud providers manage infrastructure, security, scalability, etc.

## Benefits of Serverless Computing
- Developers focus on application code and business logic.
- Facilitates creation of high-quality and optimized applications.
- Functions can be built using popular programming languages.
- Enables better testing and improved user experience.

## Cloud Providers' Responsibilities
- Manage infrastructure tasks including compute, memory, networking, and server management.
- Ensure autoscaling, high availability, security, performance, and monitoring.

## Comparison of Cloud Service Models
- **Traditional**: Entire stack managed by you.
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: You manage from OS upwards.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: You manage Application and Data layers.
- **Serverless**: You manage only the Application layer.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Entire stack managed by the cloud provider.

## Conclusion
- **Serverless Computing** allows building applications without worrying about server management.
- Enables developers to focus on coding and applications.
- Users are billed only for usage, not for idle time.

# Introduction to the FaaS Model

## **What is FaaS (Function-as-a-Service)?**
- **Definition**: FaaS allows executing code in response to events without managing complex infrastructure.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Subset of serverless computing.
  - Applications are created as multiple functions written in any programming language.
  - Can be deployed on hybrid clouds and on-premises.
  - Stateless but can maintain state using external caches.
  - Functions execute in milliseconds, processing requests in parallel.
  - Billed based on function run time, not server instance sizes.

## **Benefits of FaaS**
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only when an action occurs, no idle costs.
- **Scalability**: Functions scale automatically and independently.
- **Focus on Code**: Developers can focus on application code, reducing time-to-market.
- **High Availability**: Spread across regions and availability zones without incremental costs.

## **Components of a Serverless Stack**
1. **FaaS**: Functions-as-a-service.
2. **BaaS**: Backend-as-a-service.
3. **API Gateway**: Directs event requests to respective functions.

## **How FaaS Works**
- Event requests from various channels (HTTP, webhooks, scheduled jobs) go through the API Gateway.
- Functions process these requests, possibly interacting with backend services for further processing or storage.
- Response is sent back to the client via FaaS and API Gateway.

## **Real-world Example**
- Uploading a profile picture triggers a FaaS function that creates and stores a thumbnail image.

## **Principles and Best Practices**
- Functions should be designed for a single task.
- Code should be limited, efficient, and lightweight.
- Avoid overusing functions and third-party libraries to control costs and maintain scalability.

## **Managed and Self-managed FaaS Providers**
- **Managed Providers**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, OpenShift Cloud Functions, Netlify, Oracle, Twilio, etc.
- **Self-managed Choices**: Fission, Fn Project, Knative, OpenFaaS.

## **Conclusion**
- FaaS provides a simplified, cost-effective, and scalable approach to execute code in response to events, without dealing with infrastructure complexities.
