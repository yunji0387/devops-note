2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Ensures error-free data transmission over a physical link. It structures raw bits into data frames and manages acknowledgments from the receiver.
   
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Manages data transmission across different networks. This layer involves routing and forwarding packets to their destination via the most efficient paths.
   
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Provides reliable, transparent transfer of data between end systems. It's responsible for error recovery, flow control, and ensuring complete data transfer.
   
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Manages sessions between applications on different machines, handling setup, coordination, and termination of conversations, or sessions.
   
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Translates data between the application layer and the network. It's responsible for data encryption, decryption, and compression, ensuring the data is in the proper format.
   
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Serves as the interface for the user and application processes to access network services. This layer encompasses protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.

## Key Layers for Developers

Developers should particularly focus on the top three layers:

- **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Establishes and maintains application connections and sessions.
- **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Manages data formatting, encryption, and decryption for secure data transmission.
- **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The main interface for applications to interact with the network, crucial for web development and network-based applications.

## Implementing Security

- Secure socket layer encryption can be applied at the Presentation Layer to protect data from man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Session Key Generation**: Both parties generate session keys based on their public and private keys, allowing for secure communication.

## Ensuring TLS Security in the SDLC

To keep TLS secure within your applications, consider the following practices:

- **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**: Use CI/CD pipelines to regularly renew TLS certificates before they expire.
- **Version and Cipher Management**: Always support the latest TLS versions and robust ciphers while avoiding outdated or vulnerable ones. This often includes discontinuing support for older TLS versions like 1.0 and 1.1.

## Importance of TLS and SSL

Implementing TLS and SSL protocols is crucial for:

- **Data Confidentiality**: Ensures that data exchanged between a client and server remains confidential.
- **Data Integrity**: Guarantees that data cannot be altered undetected during transmission.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of parties communicating over the internet.

## Conclusion

TLS and SSL are foundational for secure, reliable communication on the internet.

## Key Security Terms Explained

### Authentication vs. Authorization

- **Authentication**: This is the process of verifying a user's identity to confirm they are who they claim to be. It is the first step in the security process.
- **Authorization**: Once a user's identity is confirmed, authorization is the process that determines what actions the user is permitted to perform. It ensures users can only access resources they are allowed to.

### Encryption: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric

- **Encryption**: The process of encoding information so only authorized parties can access it. It's a critical aspect of protecting sensitive data.
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encrypting and decrypting information. It's faster but requires secure key management.
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Utilizes a pair of keys (public and private) for encrypting and decrypting data. This method is more secure for distributed environments.

### Integrity

- **Integrity**: Ensures that data is real, accurate, and safeguarded against unauthorized changes. Techniques like secure hash algorithms (SHA) help verify that data has not been altered, maintaining its trustworthiness.

## Core Security Concepts in the SDLC

### CI/CD and Security

- **CI/CD**: Stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It's a method used to frequently integrate and deploy code changes through automation, improving development speed and efficiency.
  - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Regular integration of code changes that are automatically tested and merged.
  - **Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD)**:
    - **Continuous Delivery**: Automatically releases validated changes to a repository or testing environment.
    - **Continuous Deployment**: Extends continuous delivery by automatically deploying changes to production.

### Integrating Security in CI/CD

- **Early Scanning**: Implement source code scanning early in the CI stage to detect vulnerabilities before they progress further in the SDLC.
- **Security Testing**: Integrate security testing within the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that security is considered alongside other types of testing.
- **Runtime Security**: Continuously monitor and detect threats even after deployment, safeguarding applications in production environments.

## Conclusion

Understanding and correctly applying these security concepts and terms are fundamental for building secure applications. This tutorial has equipped you with the knowledge to differentiate between authentication and authorization, understand the types of encryption, and integrate essential security practices within the CI/CD pipeline.

   - Example: nmap -sS target

- **UDP Scan**:
   - Sends UDP packets to target ports to identify open UDP services.
   - Example: nmap -sU target

- **ACK Scan**:
   - Sends TCP ACK packets to determine firewall configurations.
   - Example: nmap -sA target

- **Version Detection (-sV)**:
   - Identifies service versions running on open ports.
   - Example: nmap -sV target

- **OS Detection (-O)**:
   - Attempts to identify the target's operating system.
   - Example: nmap -O target

- **Script Scanning (-sC)**:
   - Executes predefined scripts to gather additional information.
   - Example: nmap -sC target

- **Ping Scans**:
   - Various ping techniques to check target's availability.
   - Example: nmap -PE target (ICMP Echo Request)

- **Traceroute (–traceroute)**:
   - Performs traceroute to determine the path packets take.
   - Example: nmap --traceroute target

- **TCP Null Scan**:
   - Sends packets with no TCP flags set to observe responses.
   - Example: nmap -sN target

- **TCP FIN Scan**:
   - Sends packets with FIN flag set to observe responses.
   - Example: nmap -sF target

- **TCP Xmas Scan**:
   - Sends packets with various TCP flags set to observe responses.
   - Example: nmap -sX target

Each scan type serves a specific purpose in gathering information about the target network. The choice of scan depends on what kind of information you're looking for and the level of visibility you require.
- Note: Always use Nmap responsibly and ensure you have the necessary permissions to scan the target network.

## Evolution and History

Developed by Fyodor, Nmap has evolved from a simple network scanning tool to a robust, feature-rich tool used worldwide. Contributions from the community have added functionalities like the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), OS detection, and performance optimizations.

## Similar Products in the Market

While Nmap remains a leader, other tools like Zmap, Masscan, OpenVAS, Zenmap, and Wireshark also offer network scanning capabilities, each with unique features catering to different user needs.

In conclusion, Nmap is a critical tool for anyone involved in network management, security testing, or cybersecurity research. Its comprehensive capabilities make it a go-to resource in the IT and cybersecurity fields.
