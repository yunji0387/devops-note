## Take-home assignment

When given a take-home code assignment, it provides an opportunity to conduct more detailed tests.

- **Integration tests:** Check how app components interact. Simulated external dependencies offer a broader testing scope.
  
- **Functional tests:** Ensure the system operates as expected.
  
- **Regression tests:** Ensure code changes don't introduce errors.

Remember, the depth of testing varies based on time constraints, but thorough testing guarantees application functionality.

## Coding interview

In coding interviews, focus on unit testing to verify code functionality.

- **Unit tests:** Focus on individual code components to ensure they work as intended.

## Writing tests considerations

- **Readability:** Tests should be clear to other developers, improving maintainability.
  
- **Clear outcomes:** Deterministic tests ensure consistent results.

- **Automation:** Design tests for potential automation, supporting CI/CD practices.
