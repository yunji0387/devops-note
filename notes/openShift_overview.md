<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Builds

- **Definition**: A build is a process of transforming input sources (like source code) into a new, runnable object - usually a container image.
- **BuildConfig**: A crucial component that defines the build strategy and the source of the build.

## Build Strategies

- **Source-to-Image (S2I)**:
  - Combines source code with a base image to produce a new image.
  - Avoids the need for a Dockerfile.
- **Docker**:
  - Requires a Dockerfile and related artifacts.
  - Uses the `docker build` command internally.
- **Custom**:
  - User-defined build process where you create your own builder image.
  - Used for advanced use-cases beyond the standard build strategies.

## Build Inputs

- Sources for build content can include:
  - Inline Dockerfile definitions.
  - Content from existing images.
  - Git repositories.
  - Binary or Local inputs.
  - Input secrets.
  - External artifacts.

*Note*: Multiple inputs can merge in a single build, and precedence rules apply (e.g., an inline Dockerfile overrides an external one).

## ImageStreams

- Abstracts the referencing of container images within OpenShift.
- Does not store the image data itself but references to images in registries.
- Supports tagging (e.g., latest, dev, test) and automated updates/rollbacks.
- Simplifies deployment processes by referencing an image stream tag instead of specific image URLs.

## Automating Builds with Triggers

- **Webhook triggers**:
  - Automated way to invoke new builds upon events, like code updates in a Git repository.
- **Image change triggers**:
  - Monitors for updates in the base image and triggers a new build when changes are detected.
- **Configuration change triggers**:
  - Initiates builds when there are updates in the BuildConfig itself.

## BuildConfig Specification

- Defines details about the build, including source, strategy, output, and triggers.
- The strategy section specifies the build strategy (e.g., S2I, Docker, Custom).
- The output section defines where the resultant image will be pushed.

## Source-to-Image (S2I) Process

- Designed for simplicity and maintaining reproducibility.
- Integrates source code with a builder image without the need for Dockerfiles.

## Docker Build Strategy

- Involves the use of a Dockerfile to dictate how the build process should occur.
- Four implementation methods are outlined in the video.

## Custom Build Strategy

- Offers the most flexibility but requires a custom builder image with embedded build logic.
- Suitable for complex build scenarios not covered by S2I or Docker builds.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Emphasizes the need for automation in the build and deployment phases.
- Facilitates consistent and rapid application updates.

## Conclusion

- Builds are foundational to working with containerized applications in OpenShift.
- Different strategies (S2I, Docker, Custom) cater to various use-cases and complexity levels.
- ImageStreams offer a level of abstraction and convenience, working in tandem with builds for a streamlined application update process.
- Automation and CI/CD integration are vital for efficient and reliable application delivery.

# Understanding Operators in Kubernetes
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of Operators in Kubernetes, highlighting their purpose, relation to custom controllers and CRDs, and the various tools and models associated with them.

## Definition of an Operator

- **Operator**: A method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application.
  - Acts like a custom controller within the Kubernetes system to manage custom resources.
  - Automates complex tasks like application deployment, scaling, and backup/restore processes.
- **Types**:
  - **Human operators**: Manage systems manually, handle deployments, and troubleshoot issues.
  - **Software operators**: Encode human operator knowledge into software, automating manual processes.

## Operators vs. Service Brokers

- **Service Brokers**:
  - Short-lived processes, handling initial setup but not continuous operations.
  - Limited to actions at the time of installation.
- **Operators**:
  - Long-running processes, handling ongoing management tasks.
  - Continuously monitor and react to cluster state.

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- Extend Kubernetes API with custom resources.
- Used by Operators to understand and manage new kinds of stateful applications on Kubernetes clusters.

## The Operator Pattern

- **Combination** of CRDs and custom controllers.
  - Custom controllers read CRD data and manage resources to reach the desired state described by CRDs.
- Leads to the creation of **declarative APIs** within Kubernetes.

## Operator Framework

- A toolkit providing facilities to develop, test, and maintain Operators.
  - **Operator SDK**: Simplifies Operator development by leveraging Helm, Go, and Ansible. No need to understand the complexity of Kubernetes API interactions.
  - **Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)**: Manages the lifecycle of Operators within a cluster.
  - **Operator Registry**: Stores Operator components and metadata, making Operators discoverable and manageable through OLM.

## OperatorHub

- A central repository providing a collection of vetted Operators for deployment on Kubernetes clusters.
- Contains various categories of Operators:
  - **Red Hat Operators**: Tested and validated by Red Hat.
  - **Certified Operators**: Provided by third-party vendors and certified by Red Hat.
  - **Community Operators**: Contributed by the Kubernetes community, with no direct support from Red Hat.
  - **Custom Operators**: Created by users to handle specific, custom tasks.

## Operator Maturity Model

- Outlines the evolution phases of Operators, from simple installation (Basic Install) to fully automated management (Auto Pilot).
- Indicates capabilities depending on the sophistication of the Operator logic.

## Examples of Operator Tasks

- Comprehensive application deployment, including associated resources like Secrets, ConfigMaps, and storage.
- Application scaling, using intelligent automation based on the specific application type.
- Routine cluster tasks automation, such as backup and restore operations.
- Deep integration into the Kubernetes API and CLI tools (`kubectl`, `oc`).

## Conclusion

- Operators extend Kubernetes' capabilities, allowing for more sophisticated application management through automated, software-defined operations.
- The ecosystem (Operator Framework, OperatorHub) supports the entire lifecycle of Operator development and management.
- Operators signify a maturity in cluster management, moving from manual interventions to an automated "as-a-service" experience.
