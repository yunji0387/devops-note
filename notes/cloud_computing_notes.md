## CDN - Content Delivery Networks
<details close>
<summary><b>(click to expand/hide)</b></summary>
<!-- MarkdownTOC -->

# Understanding Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

## Overview

- **Definition**: A CDN is a distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery by caching website content, utilizing servers closest to the user's location.

## How CDNs Enhance Content Delivery

- **Global User Base**: Websites often have a global audience but may not have servers located worldwide, potentially slowing down content delivery due to the distances involved.

### The Problem of Distance

- **User Experience**: The further a user is from the server, the longer the content delivery time, leading to a slower website experience.
  - Sydney to Dallas: ~170 ms
  - London to Dallas: ~100 ms
  - New York to Dallas: ~40 ms
  - Los Angeles to Dallas: ~30 ms

### CDN Mechanism

- **Proximity-Based Content Delivery**: CDNs store content on multiple servers worldwide, allowing users to retrieve website data from the closest server, ensuring faster access.
- **Traffic Management**: Instead of all user requests hitting the main server, they are distributed across various geographic locations. This process significantly reduces the load on the original server.

## Benefits of Using a CDN

### Speed and Accessibility

- **Reduced Latency**: By shortening the physical distance between the user and the server, CDNs drastically cut down the data transfer time, making websites faster.
- **Global Reach**: Regardless of where the users are, they can access the content quickly due to the dispersed nature of CDN servers.

### Scalability and Reliability

- **Handling Traffic Peaks**: By spreading user requests across multiple servers, CDNs prevent overload on any single server, especially during traffic surges.
- **Increased Uptime**: Less strain on the primary server means potentially higher uptime and consistent availability.

### Security

- **Security Through Obscurity**: With the CDN acting as an intermediary between the user and the original server, there's an added layer of protection against direct attacks.
